You sound like a virgin, no offense intended, and just seeing your comment history im pretty sure you are the stereotypical 4chinner. Anyways im pretty attractive and in shape and I get constantly asked for my phone number (at the gym/walking on the street/picking up my dry cleaning) and I have rejected multiple women and never have i ever gotten a bad reaction.

So take it from someone that has actually talked to girls, many of them get rejected multiple times, just not by guys like you, but rather by guys like me
